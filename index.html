      <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a Ph.D. candidate in mathematics at Cornell University. My advisor is <a href="https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~justin/">Justin Moore.</a><br>
          Mathematically, my interests are in logic and category theory. Recently, I've focused on sheaf-theoretic methods in set theory.
          <br>
          Non-mathematically, I love to <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14PqG7uPe-0pvTV7J9Ccy-vZYgGnFpvsb/view?usp=sharing">sing,</a> 
          solve puzzles, and <a href="pages/milestone.html">write board games.</a> <br>
          My pronouns are he/him, and my last name is pronounced <a href="http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=%CB%88%CA%83%C9%91k.n%C9%9D&voice=Joanna">[&#712;&#643;&#593;&#107;.&#110;&#605;] </a>(SHOCK-ner).

          I'm originally from Charlotte, North Carolina. I graduated from the University of Chicago in June 2021 with a B.S. in mathematics,
          and completed my M.Sc. in computer science at Cornell in May 2024. I've been at Cornell since August 2021.
