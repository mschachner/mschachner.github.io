      <h2>Teaching</h2>
      <p>I love to teach! I have four semesters of experience teaching at Cornell: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> in autumn 2022, I was a recitation teaching assistant for MATH 1910 Calculus II for Engineers; </li>
          <li> in spring 2023, I was a recitation teaching assistant for MATH 2210 Linear Algebra; </li>
          <li> in autumn 2023, I was head TA / recitation TA for MATH 2940 Linear Algebra for Engineers; and </li>
          <li> in spring 2024, I was instructor of record for MATH 1120 Calculus II. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'm not teaching now, but plan to participate in the
          <a href="https://experience.cornell.edu/opportunities/cornell-prison-education-program"> Cornell Prison Education Program</a> in spring 2025.</p>
        </p>
        <h2>Outreach</h2>
        <p>In the summers of 2019 and 2020, I was a teaching assistant/counselor for <a href="https://www.beammath.org">BEAM,</a>
          an outreach program which helps increase the accessibility of advanced mathematics for underserved students.
          <br><br>
          I'm active in Cornell's <a href="https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~awm/">chapter</a> of the Association for Women in Mathematics, and served on the professional development team in spring 2024.
          <br><br>
          In autumn 2022, spring 2024, and autumn 2024, I have been a mentor to multiple undergraduate students as part of the Cornell mathematics <a href="https://sites.google.com/cornell.edu/cornell-drp">directed reading program.</a> 
          <br><br>
          In the spring of 2023, I was an instructor for Little Circle, a Cornell-run outreach program for students in grades 3-5. We learned all about infinity, fractals, and more.
          <br>
          Here is a selection of some fractals the students invented (discovered?). Scroll on mobile.</p>
